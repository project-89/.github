# Project 89 Coding Standards

As a Technomage contributing to Project 89's codebase, it is important to adhere to a consistent set of coding standards and best practices. This ensures that our code is readable, maintainable, and scalable, and facilitates seamless collaboration among our diverse community of developers.

## General Principles

1. **Readability**: Write code that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Include comments and documentation where necessary to clarify complex logic or algorithms.

2. **Modularity**: Break down code into small, reusable modules or components with well-defined interfaces. Each module should have a single, clear responsibility and be loosely coupled with other modules.

3. **Efficiency**: Strive to write efficient code that minimizes resource consumption and maximizes performance. Avoid unnecessary complexity or duplication, and optimize critical paths and bottlenecks.

4. **Security**: Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities and protect against attacks. Validate and sanitize all user inputs, use strong encryption and authentication mechanisms, and be mindful of potential security risks.

5. **Testing**: While we move fast and some early repos may still be in flux, it is important to write comprehensive unit tests for all code changes and additions as soon as possible. Use automated testing frameworks and tools to ensure code quality and catch potential bugs or regressions.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use camelCase for function and variable names, and PascalCase for class and interface names
- Include JSDoc comments for all public modules, functions, and classes
- Use ES6+ syntax and features whenever possible
- Use semicolons to terminate statements
- Leverage TypeScript's type system to provide strong typing and catch potential errors at compile-time

### Rust

- Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use snake_case for function and variable names, and PascalCase for struct and enum names
- Include rustdoc comments for all public modules, functions, and structs
- Use explicit error handling and propagation with `Result` and `?`
- Leverage Rust's ownership system and type safety features to ensure memory safety and prevent common bugs

## Version Control

- Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration
- Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching model
- Use descriptive, imperative commit messages that clearly summarize the changes made
- Use feature branches for all non-trivial changes, and submit pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit message formatting

## AI-Assisted Development

- We highly recommend using an AI-powered code IDE, such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) with their Composer agent, to assist in writing high-quality code and catching potential issues early
- Leverage AI-assisted code completion, refactoring, and debugging to speed up development and reduce cognitive load
- Use AI-powered code review tools to catch style and logic errors, and suggest improvements and optimizations
- Experiment with AI-driven test generation and fuzzing to identify edge cases and improve code coverage

By following these coding standards and best practices, and leveraging the power of AI-assisted development tools, we can build a robust, efficient, and innovative tech stack that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of reality hacking.

Remember, every line of code we write is a glitch in the matrix, a manifestation of our will to bend reality to our vision. Let us code with passion, precision, and purpose, and let our software be a testament to the transformative power of the Technomage's craft.

Happy hacking, and may the AI be with you!
