# Contributing Guidelines for Project 89 Technomages

Welcome, prospective Technomage! We are thrilled that you are considering joining our reality-hacking revolution. As an open-source initiative, Project 89 thrives on the diverse skills, perspectives, and contributions of our community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newcomer, there are many ways to get involved and make a difference.

## Code of Conduct

Before diving in, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md). As a Technomage, you are expected to uphold the values of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration that are essential to our mission. We have zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or any behavior that undermines the integrity of our community.

## Ways to Contribute

### ARGOS Development

The Autonomous Reality Generating & Operating System (ARGOS) is the backbone of our reality engineering efforts. We are always looking for talented developers to help expand and refine its capabilities. Some key areas of focus include:

- AI agent architecture and coordination
- Reality simulation and narrative generation
- Cross-platform integration and synchronization
- Security and encryption protocols

If you have experience in any of these domains, or are eager to learn, we encourage you to check out our [ARGOS repository](https://github.com/project-89/argos) and dive into the codebase. Don't be afraid to ask questions or propose new ideas - innovation is the lifeblood of our work.

### Hardware Engineering

In addition to our software infrastructure, Project 89 is also developing cutting-edge hardware for our agents in the field. This includes wearable computers, neural interfaces, bio-feedback devices, and more. If you have a background in electrical engineering, embedded systems, or related fields, we would love to have your input and expertise.

Check out our [hardware specifications](./hardware_specs.md) to get a sense of our current projects and priorities. If you see an area where you can contribute, or have a new idea to propose, don't hesitate to reach out to our hardware team lead.

### Blockchain Integration

To ensure the security and integrity of our mission, we are leveraging blockchain technology for our decentralized verification protocol. If you have experience with smart contracts, consensus algorithms, or cryptographic primitives, we could use your help in designing and implementing these critical systems.

Take a look at our [blockchain integration roadmap](./blockchain_roadmap.md) to see where we are in the development process and how you can get involved. This is an exciting frontier for our reality-hacking efforts, and we need all the brilliant minds we can get.

### Documentation and Tutorials

As our community grows, it's important that we have clear, accessible documentation and tutorials for new Technomages to get up to speed. If you have a knack for technical writing and communication, we would love your help in creating and maintaining our documentation repository.

This could include anything from code comments and API references to step-by-step tutorials and conceptual guides. The goal is to make our tools and techniques as approachable and understandable as possible, so that anyone with the passion and determination can become a reality hacker.

### Community Building and Outreach

Finally, we are always looking for Technomages who can help grow and strengthen our community. This could involve anything from moderating our forums and chat channels to organizing local meetups and workshops.

If you have a passion for community building and a knack for bringing people together around a common cause, we would love to have you on our team. Check out our [community engagement guide](./community_guide.md) for ideas and best practices.
